<p><b>The Sad History Of The Young Boy.</b>
    <p>The first morning of his first day at school his mother tell him that she will be there at the end of the journey to pick him up.
    <p>The young boy full of joy start the day in his new school with a smile on his face knowing that his mother will be there.
<p>His name is Finn, 7 years old, he started to make new friends without knowing much about them and he didn't them any questions about them.
    <p>Some of his friends were doing some stylish hairstyle and not him, Finn was a simple boy, nothing extravagance on him as clothes, shoes, hands bracelets etc...
<p> They seen very disappointed with Finn because he wasn't the kind of boy they thought he was, they planned of doing a dirty joke to him.
    <p>One of them tell Finn to go to the back of the school to play during the recess, Finn considering them as "friends" and said " okay let's go playing".
<p> They were five behind the school playing Hide N' Seek, as Finn was the new boy in their class he had the role of the seeker, they tell him to stand in the middle of them
    and to close his eyes. Finn do what they said and with an evil laugh they started to kick him and take off his shirt and throw it in the mud.
    <p>They left him alone crying with a muddy shirt on thinking that for them it was a joke. Later on Finn joined the class and sat down without saying anything to avoid crying 
    infront of his teacher and to also avoid getting into troubles with these boy.
    <p>Time passes and finally it's the end of this terrible day. Waiting for his mother to pick him up after work the four boy come to him and start stealing his things
        all the parents were looking at this like it's a normal thing to them and decide to continue their way. It was so violent that they ripped Finn's shirt.
        <p>Finn's mother arrived seeing them abusing of their power, and knowing that her son can't do nothing against them, she rushed into them and she asked them 
            what are they doing and why they are doing this to her son.
    <P>They quickly ran away without answering the questions of the mother. Finn get up on his feet and hug his mom and he tells her all the bad
        things that they've done to him behind the school and he also show his muddy shirt to his mom.
    <p> All of these four have something that Finn doesn't the chance to have all of them have a dad which bring money every months, whereas Finn doesn't a dad, not much money
        because his mother hasn't get the chance to go to school she works as housewife and her salary is very low enough to pay her bills only.
    They make fun of Finn without knowing what kind of life he has.</p>
